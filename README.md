1. BBT
=========

1.1 What is it?

	This is a small, easy to use, scriptable black box test engine for json based web services.

	It helps with
		- documenting your web service API request and responses
		- validating web service responses JSON properties and structure
			- by existance, type, custom javascript expressions
		- doing automated massive testing of a web service API
		- can be integrated with monitor systems

1.2 Why?

	I developed BBT because I did not find an easy to use, light and portable open source solution.

1.2 Who did this?

	BBT was programmed by Andreas Drewke at SlipShift GmbH. SlipShift allowed me to open source this! Thank you. Maybe someone has a use for it. 

1.4 Requirements

	JSON for JAVA, see http://www.json.org/java/
